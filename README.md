The Bilkent Introduction Portal is a web-based platform designed to automate and simplify the organization of campus tours and events. By offering dedicated panels for admins, guides, and guests, it ensures seamless coordination, real-time updates, and efficient data management. This portal enhances the tour experience for all users by streamlining processes, reducing errors, and providing a more intuitive and transparent system.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind the Bilkent Introduction Portal is to answer the inefficiencies and manual errors in the current system of organizing campus tours. By automating key processes, improving communication, and offering real-time updates, this platform aims to streamline tour management and provide a more seamless experience for both administrators and visitors.

## **Goals**

The primary goals of the Bilkent Introduction Portal are:

* Automating and easing the process of informative events, mainly tours, from the request phase until their completion.  
* Improving the efficiency of assigning tours by automating the application, acceptance, and confirmation processes.  
* Streamlining data management by integrating guide and tour information into a unified system, enhancing the coordination between guides and advisors to minimize manual errors and delays, meanwhile allowing customization and modification of the  experiences on campus.

## **Problem**

The current system suffers from several inefficiencies, including the manual transfer of tour information between systems, which is prone to errors and delays, and the inability to automatically detect duplicate tour applications, leading to scheduling conflicts. Advisors often miss deadlines for uploading tour schedules, resulting in delays in guide assignments, while guides lack real-time access to updates on tours and fairs, making it difficult to plan effectively. Additionally, managing guide information manually increases the potential for errors in assignments and payroll processing. Furthermore, data management is fragmented across multiple platforms, complicating both the coordination of events and data analysis efforts.

## **Features**

* **Analytics:** An interface for accessing detailed data of eventuated tours and their analytics to determine and update the office’s attitudes toward the high schools.   
* **Duplicate Detection System:** Automated detection and flagging of duplicate tour applications will streamline the scheduling process and minimize conflicts.

**Guide Panel:**

* **Real-Time Tour Updates:** Guides will receive real-time notifications for assigned tours, upcoming events, and fairs, allowing them to plan effectively.  
* **Work Log and Attendance:** A dedicated section for guides to log their work hours for tours and events, making it easier to track participation and process payments.  
* **Tour Assignment Visibility:** Guides can view and claim tours available on their assigned days, reducing confusion and ensuring balanced workloads.

* **Personalized Tour Information:** Guests will receive relevant treatment based on their interests or preferences they put on the system while registering, ensuring a more tailored experience.  
* **Visual Tour:** The Visual Tour feature in the Guest Panel allows prospective visitors to explore the Bilkent campus virtually.
